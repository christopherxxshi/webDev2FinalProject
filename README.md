## Project Description

Ask Overflow is the best place to post your questions and get back great answers from highly talented people.
The users can upvote the question if they find its relevant one and do the vice versa. Askoverflow is made with intension to specifically target the questions based on language category.

This website is designed specifically for answering and posting technical questions. It’s a website for questions and answers for enthusiastic programmers.

It will allow users to select a particular computer language, then post their erroneous code or doubts on the website along with a picture(if available) of the error message. Other users will be able to comment/answer the posted question, if they are logged in.

Each of the questions will have votes and based on the votes, the questions will be sorted having the highest votes. The users will be able to post a question only if they are logged in and if the user is not logged in, then they will be able to view the question and answers, but not able to post a question. Also users will be able to search for their question through a search bar provided.

Users can also view the top asked questions.

## Course Technologies

__React__:
We​​ will ​​use ​​React ​​as ​​our​​ single-page web​ ​application ​​framework.​​We ​​will ​​create components ​​for ​​the ​​elements ​​that ​​we ​​include ​​on ​​our ​​pages.

__Firebase Auth__:
This technology will be used for user authentication. We will use this authentication technology to authenticate users using email/password. Using this we will authorize users for our website. User can login using Google account.

__Redis__:
We will use Redis to fetch recently asked questions when a user hits the home page.


## Independent Technologies

__ImageMagick__:
When a user uploads a picture, server will use ImageMagick to compress the image and store it.

__FuzzySearch__:

We will use FuzzySearch as a search engine to search for the question based on title. Fuzzy Search helps the users to find out the previousl asked question without knowing the complete terms. Also the search is sorted and optimized to show the questions with highest votes

__D3.js__:
We use this to find out the current trend, the top asked questions. D3.js is the best way of visualising the trends of questions. We have adopted this tehnology with React for data visualization.
